# C++ modules using openCV

This folder is where all the modules developed in c++ are located when using openCV

## Getting Started

This folder is the main repository for the c++ modules that are separated into several subfolders:
1. detection Algorithm [detectionAlgorithm](https://github.com/NunoDuarte/openCVdevelop/tree/master/cpp/detectionAlgorithm)
2. haar Classifier [haarClassifier](https://github.com/NunoDuarte/openCVdevelop/tree/master/cpp/haarClassifier)
4. video Camera [videoCamera](https://github.com/NunoDuarte/openCVdevelop/tree/master/cpp/videoCamera)

### inside detection Algorithm
1. color Dectection [colorDetection](https://github.com/NunoDuarte/openCVdevelop/tree/master/cpp/detectionAlgorithm/colorDetection)
2. gaze Dectection [gazeDetection](https://github.com/NunoDuarte/openCVdevelop/tree/master/cpp/detectionAlgorithm/gazeDetection)
3. object Detection [objectDetection](https://github.com/NunoDuarte/openCVdevelop/tree/master/cpp/detectionAlgorithm/objectDetection)
4. scenario Detection [scenarioDetection](https://github.com/NunoDuarte/openCVdevelop/tree/master/cpp/detectionAlgorithm/scenarioDetection)
