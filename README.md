# Useful multi-purpose openCV projects
Code is available in two programming languages:
- [Python](https://github.com/NunoDuarte/openCVdevelop/tree/master/python) modules using openCV
- [C++](https://github.com/NunoDuarte/openCVdevelop/tree/master/c++)  modules using openCV

One folder is reserved for ready to use DeepNN approaches in Python
- [Deep](https://github.com/NunoDuarte/openCVdevelop/tree/master/deep) Learning modules using openCV

## Info
- Ubuntu 20.04 works only with Opencv 4.5.5 (early versions might not work since with 4.2.0 the frame rate and image quality of a usb camera is slow and low, respectively.
  - compile from source the opencv-4.5.5 

## Goals:
- [ ] run haarclassifier using opencv with gpu enable
- [ ] use a pre-train network to detect and mark objects in a image
- [ ] move the application to video
- [ ] train a new network to the objects of my choosing
- [ ] check the speed in the new machine
