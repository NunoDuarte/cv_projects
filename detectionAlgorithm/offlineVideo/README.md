# Python modules using openCV

This folder is where the modules developed in python for the offline mode of the detection system are located when using openCV

## Getting Started

This folder is the main repository for the offline mode Python modules that are separated into several subfolders:
1. Human-Human Interaction Experiment [hhi](https://github.com/NunoDuarte/openCVdevelop/tree/master/detectionAlgorithm/offlineVideo/hhi)
2. Human-Robot Interaction Experiment [icub](https://github.com/NunoDuarte/openCVdevelop/tree/master/detectionAlgorithm/offlineVideo/icub)
